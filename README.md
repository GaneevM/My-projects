# My Projects

This repo has a bunch of games and simulations I’ve made while learning Python. they are small projects where I tried out different ideas, like simulations and visualizing things in a fun way.

## Chem Lab
This is an interactive chem-lab game where you drag elements from the periodic table and combine them to make new things. As you keep playing, the goals get harder and harder until you unlock more complex creations.

Source code is in alchemy.py  

## Battle Bot Simulator
This is a simple battle simulation where robots fight each other based on your decision of parts and their individual behaviors that the users or AI controls. I made this to experiment with game logic and how different parts of machines work together to be work better.

Source code is in battlebotsim.py  

## Pandemic Simulator
This game simulates how a virus spreads across the world. It includes a map and different mechanics that control how fast they spread along with the vaccination status and you can choose to include airplanes and boats in the simulation. I uploaded an accurate world map with borders using a geojson file.

Source code is in pandemicsim.py  

## Circuit Simulator
This is a basic circuit simulator made to practice physics and electrical concepts. You can build simple circuits and see how they behave. It includes switches and voltemeters to add realism

Source code is in circuitsim.py

## Graphing Calculator
This is a small graphing calculator that lets you plot math functions and visualize equations.

Source code is in graphingcalculator.py

## How to play
-Navigate to releases

-Press on the game you want to try

-Once the game downloads, open it and run it

-Have fun!
